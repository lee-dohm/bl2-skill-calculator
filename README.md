# Borderlands 2 Skill Tree Calculator

I decided to write this in order to teach myself Rails. I was inspired because I was using [this Borderlands 2 skill calculator website][bl2skills] but it didn't record the *order* in which the build is created. This is important for me because I'm alt-happy.In any game with character classes I generally have a bunch of low- to mid-level characters and one or *maybe* two higher-level characters. Often the order in which the skill points are assigned is more important than some of the later skills.
